The idea of the project is to create a blog that can be used as a portfolio storage.

All users can: 
- see all the posts
- create posts
- comments posts
- update user's posts and comments

The aithorized user may:
- delete posts and comments
- update posts and comments

Preliminary ideas to implement (if I have time and enough knowledge):
- send info to user's email


The models:

1. User:
- name
- last name
- bio
- picture
- email

2.Post:
- date
- title
- tag
- body
- link to GH
- code snippet (image)
- author (user)
- comments

3. Comments (for Post)
- date
- author (user)
- body
